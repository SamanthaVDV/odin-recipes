This is a simple recipe website built using only HTML. It serves as a reflection of my journey in learning the basics of HTML, Linux terminal, and GitHub. The website features recipes with ingredient lists, cooking instructions, and photos.

Getting Started
    To view the website, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Features
    Recipes organized in an easy-to-read format
    Ingredient lists for each recipe
    Cooking instructions with clear, step-by-step instructions
    Photos of each dish to give you an idea of what the final result should look like

Learning Outcomes
    Through building this website, I have gained a deeper understanding of:
        HTML syntax and structure
        Creating and styling HTML pages using CSS
        Basic terminal commands in Linux
        The GitHub workflow (e.g. committing, pushing, pulling, and branching)

Future Improvements
    While this website is functional, there is always room for improvement. Some ideas for future improvements include:       
        Implementing responsive design for better viewing on different devices
        Adding user-submitted recipes and a commenting system for social engagement
        Incorporating CSS for improved styling and visual appeal
        Adding the ability to multiply or divide recipes for larger or smaller portions, providing more flexibility and customization for the user.

Conclusion
    Building this recipe website has been a rewarding experience. Not only have I learned a lot about HTML, Linux terminal, and GitHub, but I have also created a functional website that I can continue to build upon in the future.
